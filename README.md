## LeetCode Java

* author: @ryoishizawa
* Personal project to put the solutions of leetcode questions.

## Format

* The following code is the example how to write code in this project:

```
package code121;

/**
 * @author ryoishizawa
 * 
 * 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
 */
public class BestTimeToBuyAndSellStock {

}

class Solution {
    /**
     * Brute force approach
     * Time Complexity: O(n^2), Space Complexity: O(1)
     */
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
    ...
}
```

The point is:
* The Folder name must be `src/codeXXX` (XXX is the number of the problem)
* Write the name of the question
* Main class name is also the name of the question
* In the solution, try to write Time Complexity and Spece Complexity
